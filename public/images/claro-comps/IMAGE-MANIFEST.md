## Image Guidelines

### For Product Screenshots:
- Use demo/mock data only (no real client info)
- Ensure text is readable at smaller sizes
- Clean, professional interface shots
- Light mode preferred for consistency with page design
- Export as PNG for screenshots (better quality than JPG)

### Priority Order:
1. **Demo Video Link** - Most important, shows everything
2. **Dashboard Screenshot** - Shows the actual product
3. **Before/After Comparison** - Demonstrates the value
4. **Template Upload** - Shows key functionality
5. **Results Screen** - Shows the output

## Notes

- The simplified page focuses on story over features
- Each image should support the narrative, not just show features
- Keep it humble and personal - not a sales pitch
- Demo video is the most important addition
- If time is limited, prioritize: Demo Video → Dashboard → Before/After
