# Off-Grid Robotaxi Charging - Project Page

## Overview
A simplified, story-focused project page exploring the feasibility of off-grid solar + battery charging stations for autonomous vehicle fleets.

## Design Philosophy
- **Story over specs** - Personal curiosity about the future of transportation
- **Humble exploration** - A thought experiment, not a business plan
- **Clear economics** - Focus on the financial model and key constraints
- **Forward-thinking** - Understanding tomorrow's infrastructure questions today

## Page Structure (5 Sections)

### 1. Hero Section
**Purpose:** Set up the question and visual concept  
**Key Elements:**
- Project title and central question
- Two key stats (100% Solar, $0.08/kWh target)
- Concept rendering placeholder
- Scroll indicator to story

**Tone:** Curious and forward-thinking

---

### 2. Why This Question Matters (The Story)
**Purpose:** Personal motivation and context  
**Key Elements:**
- Fascination with robotaxis and cost-per-mile race
- Energy as a competitive advantage for fleets
- The core question: can off-grid compete with the grid?
- Framing as exploration, not business plan

**Tone:** Thoughtful, curious, humble

---

### 3. The Concept
**Purpose:** Explain how it would work  
**Key Elements:**
- Three-part system (Solar → Batteries → Fleet Charging)
- The trade-off: station closes at night
- Key assumptions (location, pricing, operations)
- Visual explanation with icons

**Tone:** Clear and straightforward

---

### 4. What I Modeled
**Purpose:** Show the analysis work  
**Key Elements:**
- Model components (CapEx, OpEx, Revenue, Sensitivity)
- Excel model screenshots (overview, costs, sensitivity)
- Key findings: tight but possible
- Battery costs as critical variable

**Tone:** Analytical but accessible

---

### 5. What I Learned
**Purpose:** Reflect on insights  
**Key Elements:**
- Understanding constraints vs. building business
- Battery costs as make-or-break
- Operational trade-offs matter
- Forward-thinking mindset

**Tone:** Reflective, curious
